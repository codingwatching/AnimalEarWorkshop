Setting up the Mog Time system together with TerraxLighting system.

Step 1:
Downloading the Mog Time system  -> Go to https://atelierrgss.wordpress.com/rmv-timesystem-hud/
You will download the Mog_Master_MV.zip.

Step 2: 
This zip contains a lot of plugins, you can use them all, but if you are only interested in the time system
these are the files you need

Mogmaster_MV/js/plugins/MOG_TimeSystem.js
Mogmaster_MV/js/plugins/MOG_TimeSystem_Hud.js
Mogmaster_MV/img/system/TimeHud_A.png
Mogmaster_MV/img/system/TimeHud_B.png
Mogmaster_MV/img/system/TimeHud_C.png
Mogmaster_MV/img/system/TimeHud_D.png
Mogmaster_MV/img/system/TimeHud_E.png

Copy these files to the right place in the game directory.

Step 3:
Start up RPGMaker MV, load your game and go to the plugin-manager
Add MOG_Timesystem and MOG_Timesystem_HUD
In the parameters of MOG_Timesystem set the parameter 'Tint screen' to false.  <-don't forget or you get double tinting

Step 4:
In the TerraxLighting plugin go to the parameters and set parameter 'Save daynighthours' to 0  <-don't forget or you get weird time jumps

Step 5: 
To activate the Mog Time system together with the TerraxLigthing system use the plugin call 
Plugin command : tls_moghunter on
You only need to call this once.
When its activated any map with the note-tag 'mogtimesystem' will have the screen tinted by the terraxlighting depending on the mog time.

Step 6:(optional, always supply 6 colors, only needs to be called once)
If you do not like the default colors you can change them with the following plugin call:
plugin command : tls_moghunter tint #555555 #FFEFD5 #FFFFFF #EEE8AA #555555 #111111     
The colors are for: Dawn, Rise, Day, Set, Dusk, Night

Should you need to turn it off, you can use plugin command : tls_moghunter off

Step 6: It should work now, if not you can ask in the forums.
